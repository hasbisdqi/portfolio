When it comes to displaying code snippets in your MDX-powered blog, **Rehype Pretty Code** provides an elegant and customizable solution. Whether you want syntax highlighting, line numbering, or advanced theming, this tool allows you to present code in a visually appealing way.

## Why Use Rehype Pretty Code?

MDX (Markdown + JSX) is a powerful way to write content for blogs and documentation sites. However, displaying code snippets effectively requires additional tools. **Rehype Pretty Code** stands out due to:

- **Advanced Syntax Highlighting** - Supports multiple programming languages.
- **Custom Themes** - Choose from predefined themes like Dracula, GitHub, or even define your own.
- **Line Numbering** - Improve readability with optional line numbers.
- **Line and Word Highlights** - Highlight specific lines or words within the code.
- **Customizable Components** - Modify how code blocks render in your MDX setup.

## Setting Up Rehype Pretty Code in MDX

To integrate Rehype Pretty Code into your Next.js or Vite project, follow these steps:

### Installation

```sh
npm install rehype-pretty-code
```

### Configuration in Next.js

Modify your `next.config.mjs` or MDX configuration:

```js
import rehypePrettyCode from "rehype-pretty-code";

export default {
  rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, { theme: "dracula" }]],
};
```

## Using Code Blocks with Custom Styling

Once configured, you can use enhanced code blocks in your MDX files. Here’s an example demonstrating syntax highlighting, line numbers, and line highlights:

```js {1,3}
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message); // Highlighted line
function greet() {
  return "Hi there!";
}
```

### Word Highlighting

If you want to emphasize specific words or variables within a code snippet, you can do so by specifying highlight rules:

```js {"highlight": ["message", "console.log"]}
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```

## Choosing the Right Theme

Rehype Pretty Code allows you to customize themes to match your blog’s aesthetic. Some popular themes include:

- **Dracula** (Dark mode-friendly, vibrant colors)
- **GitHub** (Classic look, great for documentation)
- **Night Owl** (Dark mode with rich contrast)
- **Custom Themes** (Define your own styles)

To use a custom theme, you can modify the configuration:

```js
export default {
  rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, { theme: "my-custom-theme" }]],
};
```

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues

1. **Code Blocks Not Rendering Properly?**
   - Ensure MDX is correctly set up with `next-mdx-remote` or `@mdx-js/loader`.
   - Double-check the rehype plugin installation.

2. **Theme Not Applying?**
   - Verify that the correct theme name is used.
   - Try switching themes to debug the issue.

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid excessive customizations that slow down rendering.
- Optimize code snippets by limiting unnecessary styling.
- Use lazy loading if you have a large number of code blocks.
