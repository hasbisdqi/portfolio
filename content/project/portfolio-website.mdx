# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was designed and developed to showcase my work, skills, and experience in a clean, modern interface. The site features a responsive design, smooth animations, and an intuitive navigation system.

## Key Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Project showcase with detailed case studies
- Contact form with validation
- Blog section for sharing insights and experiences

## Development Process

I started by creating wireframes and mockups in Figma, focusing on a clean and minimal aesthetic that would highlight the content. After finalizing the design, I implemented the frontend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with Framer Motion for animations.

## Technical Implementation

The site is built with Next.js App Router for optimized routing and page transitions. I used Server Components where possible to improve performance and SEO. The styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS for a consistent design system and rapid development.

For the animations, I used Framer Motion to create smooth transitions between pages and elements. The contact form uses server actions for validation and submission, with error handling and success feedback.
